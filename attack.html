<h1>Attack Profile</h1>
<p>Liverpool has a formidable attack, with two wingers on the side that provide creativity and width and one striker who looks for the goals up top.</p>

      <h3>Cody Gakpo</h3>
        <p>Cody Gakpo makes things happen. During the 2022 World Cup, a relatively unknown player took centre stage, scoring 3 goals in 5 games and carrying Netherlands to the quarter-finals,
          where they bowed out against Argentina. This impressive campaign led to many teams wanting to sign him, and it was Liverpool who landed him. Gakpo has since been a very reliable source of
          goals. Even when he plays bad, he can score and win a game. This is brilliant to have in your team, a match winner that can change a game with just once shot.

      <h3>Mohamed Salah</h3>
        <p>Mohamed Salah is a household name. His incredible record over the last 8 years for Liverpool has had him considered one of the greatest players in the world for a <em>long</em> time,
          and one of the greatest players to ever play in the premier league. Year after year, questions are asked whether he can keep being superhuman. Can he do it again this season?
          Time and time again he comes through. He is Liverpool's number 1, he always is, and to write him off is to have not watched football for the last 8 years.
