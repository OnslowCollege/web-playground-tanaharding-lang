<h1>Defensive Profile</h1>
<p>Liverpool play a back four formation, with a keeper between the sticks, a left and right sided fullback and two center backs in the middle.</p>

      <h3>Alisson Becker</h3>
        <p>Alisson Becker is Liverpool's trusty number 1. He joined the club in 2018 and instantly became that reliable rock at the back and exploded into one of the best goalkeepers in the world. 
        His saves were a key part of Liverpool's UEFA Champions League in the 2018/2019 season, and also their Premier League success the following year. Liverpool would be nowhere near where they
        are now without his status as one of the best in his position.</p>

    <div class="kerkeztext">
      <h3>Milos Kerkez</h3>
        <p>Milos Kerkez is one of many new additions to Liverpool's side. He is a new recruit from AFC Bournemouth, following an impressive season from them. He was voted the best left back
          in the premier league last season and Liverpool, with their aging left back Robertson declining last season, decided the time was right to reinvest into a new promising left sided
          full back to take the reins for the foreseeable future.

    <section id="section_rightback" class="grid">
    <div class="frimpongtext">
      <h3>Jeremie Frimpong</h3>
        <p>Jeremie Frimpong is another new young gun. He has exploded in the Bundesliga while playing at Leverkusen in the last few years. He has made his name not only for being solid defensively, 
          but also an absolute rocket down the right flank, with an incredible speed that allows him to fly forwards and get his share of the goals and assists from right back. He has huge shoes to fill 
          following the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who had played at Liverpool for years as a key playmaker with a range of passes that could easily flip a game.

    </div>
    <div class="vandijktext">
      <h3>Virgil Van Dijk</h3>
        <p>Virgil Van Dijk is Liverpool's big leader. The big man is an imperious defender that is not only a rock at the back, but the team's captain and voice of reason. Since his arrival at
          the club in 2018, Van Dijk has become regarded as one of if not the greatest defenders in the world and has been absolutely vital to all of the team's recent success. His consistency
          makes him an ever present, his spot in the team has always been cemented and he has backed it up with monstrous performances year after year.

   <div class="konatetext">
      <h3>Ibrahima Konate</h3>
        <p>Ibrahima Konate has been Van Dijk's steady partner since his arrival in 2021. His huge stature and commanding presence made him a real mission to get past, and him and Van Dijk were
          able to dominate both aerially and physically with ease. Konate is still young and very promising and Liverpool aren't the only team trying to put him to use. Mega club Real Madrid have
          recently made Konate a transfer target, and along with his questionable recent form, concerns are being raised of if Konate should be replaced, making this season a potential career defining one for the frenchman's career.
