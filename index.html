<p>Liverpool Football Club was established in 1892 and has since had a rich history filled 
  trophies and memorable victories, making them one of the biggest clubs in England and the world.
  They have enjoyed modern success as well, most recently winning the coveted premier league last season.
  As the league champions, Liverpool manager Arne Slot has assembled a super squad, adding to a very strong 
  team with a number of big money signings of new players to take Liverpool to the next level. Whether you
  are a new fan trying to find out about our players, or an old fan that has been overwhelmed by the amount of
  recent changes to the squad, you can read all about the entire Liverpool starting eleven for the 25/26 season.
