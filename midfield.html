<h1>Midfield Profile</h1>
<p>Liverpool have two central box-to-box midfielders that are key for their shape in the middle of the park
    and one attacking playmaker who helps out the team on attack.<br>Liverpool have more than 3 great midfielders though, which is a good problem to have as the players must battle for the 3 spots.</p>
