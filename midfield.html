<h1>Midfield Profile</h1>
<p>Liverpool have two central box-to-box midfielders that are key for their shape in the middle of the park
    and one attacking playmaker who helps out the team on attack.<br>Liverpool have more than 3 great midfielders though, which is a good problem to have as the players must battle for the 3 spots.</p>

      <h3>Ryan Gravenberch</h3>
        <p>Ryan Gravenberch has flipped a switch since the arrival of fellow dutchman Arne Slot. His potential didn't seem to be fully reached in his first season at Liverpool in 23/24, but last season
          he showed the world what he could really do. His resistance to press allowed him to be a key figure in Liverpool's progression up the field, as he was able to carry it forwards and find great wide options.
          His defensive capablilities also offered a very nice extra layer of defence that made Liverpool just that little bit harder to break down.

      <h3>Dominik Szoboszlai</h3>
        <p>Dominik Szoboszlai has been by far Liverpool's best player this season. Since his arrival in 2023, he has been on and off in terms of form at Liverpool, but his class has shone through.
          His intense workrate up and down paired with his ferocious intent and power going forward is what makes Szoboszlai tick. He is everywhere, at every time. And Dominik is not shy of having
          a crack from distance, and can decide a game from 30 yards out. He is always there at the nick of time at any sign of danger at the back too, making him a model midfielder.

      <h3>Florian Wirtz</h3>
        <p>Florian Wirtz has been in the spotlight recently. He arrived at Liverpool for a staggering £116 million. The german was one of the world's top talents. Coming from the Bundesliga,
          Wirtz played as an incredibly creative playmaker and very capable goal scorer. When the premier league champions added him to their roster, it looked like nothing would ever stop them,
          but it hasn't quite panned out that way. Wirtz, along with Liverpool, have struggled so far this season, but once they and Wirtz click, then there is a serious all-star team brewing.
